This table shows which operators are stronger than others, associativity is marked as "left to right" for left-associative operators and "right to left" for right-associative operators.
This table also includes expressions that are not operator expressions, anyway, it might be helpful to know that they are parsed assuming this figurative precedence.

> Precedence index is placed just for some help, sometimes you need to know the order.

The table is from high to low precedence ordered -- the operators in the first row have the strongest precedence.

|  N  | Operator groups / expressions | Associativity |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 20  | Paths (`::`) | N/A |
| 19  | Field expression (aka member access - `a.b`) | left to right |
| 18  | Invocations (aka calls - `a(...)`), array access (aka indexing - `a[...]`) | N/A |
| 17  | [Postfix operators] `?` | N/A |
| 16  | [Prefix operators] `!`, `&`, `&mut`, `-`, `*` | N/A |
| 15  | `as` | left |
| 14  | `*` `/` `%` | left |
| 13  | `+` `-` | left |
| 12  | `..` `..=` | Non-associative |
| 11  | `<<` `>>` | left |
| 10  | `&` (infix) | left |
|  9  | `^` | left |
|  8  | `∣` | left |
|  7  | `in` | Non-associative |
|  6  | `<=>` | Non-associative |
|  5  | `<` `>` `<=` `=>` | Non-associative |
|  4  | `==` `!=` | Non-associative |
|  3  | `and` | left |
|  2  | `or` | left |
|  1  | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `&=` `∣=` `^=` `<<=` `>>=` | left |

Prefix operators: `not`, `&` (borrow), `&mut` (borrow as mutable, `&` and `mut` can have whitespace between), `-` (negation), `*` (dereference).

Postfix operators: `?` (optional chaining), `!` (unwrap).

  <summary>Range operators precedence [why?]</summary>
  <blockquote>
    Range operators have this kind of precedence as we want to write `a..b+1` which means `a..(b+1)`
    as far as writing `a..b == c..d` which means `(a..b) == (c..d)`
