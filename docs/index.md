# Jacy DevBook

## What is DevBook

This is kind of a notebook where I write as much as I can about _Jacy_. You can think of it as a collection of dev guide, user guide, code documentation and RFCs, but at the WIP stage. You can find some development documentation but it is not exhaustive, same for user guides and RFCs.

## How to use DevBook

If you are interested in the _Jacy_ compiler and how it works you can find an abstract description for almost every stage in the [compiler workflow](compiler-workflow/index.md), which includes information about the important parts of the compiler, i.e. there's no information about logging, suggestions, etc. but about IRs and the main logic.

That's not the real documentation especially a tutorial, just some thoughts about the view on this project. I mostly
will explain why I've chosen certain solutions and not how to work with them. Some thoughts may seem simple and
meticulous, but I want to cover even the simplest aspects of PL.
