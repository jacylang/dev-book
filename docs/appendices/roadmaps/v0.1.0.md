# v0.1.0 Plan

Okay, finally. I came up with too many feature ideas, and the problem is that, currently, the compiler handles too many features for a WIP project, and a large part of them are not fully implemented. This is why I want to describe a list of required features for the first alpha version. It may be extended or shrank but must contain only features required to make basic programs.

I'll try to reason the appearance of each feature in this list.

At first, I'll describe a brief list, separating features by scopes.
Also, there will be features marked with the {:@backlog:} label, these features are excluded from the first alpha version and not required for the base functionality.

## Basics

These won't be a list of `struct`, `func`, etc. as from the view of syntax and semantics, these items are required to express even the most basic things in _Jacy_, anyway some features related to them are not required.

It's really hard for me, to decline some features to include in the first version, as I see them as really important.
For example, generics is kind of an additional feature, but without generics, I cannot even add the `Option` type.
