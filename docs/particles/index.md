# Particles

Particles (stands for particular + article) is a note with thoughts on a specific decision that was not that easy to establish.

Some of the particles are in fact ideas and must be moved.

Instead of writing large papers containing things I (don't) want to see in _Jacy_, I want to describe a collection of features. These are kind of RFCs but particles are more specific and more about specific decisions that are not mostly discussed.

I want to keep a list of almost every particular decision I've made to make it possible in the future to assemble the full picture of what _Jacy_ became.
