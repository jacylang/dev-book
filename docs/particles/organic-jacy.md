# Organic _Jacy_

The idea of organic _Jacy_ is to have deeper underlying language than main and unsafe dialect.

Organic is a dialect of _Jacy_ which does not replace but extends the functionality.
It is kind of `unsafe` code but from the view of compiler stability, safety, etc.

If some feature idea sounds awkward or dangerous for target user, but by the way is well-formed and working -- it can be added to organic dialect.

## Some notes

### Parser extension?

Organic _Jacy_ does not extend parser, it does not include DSL for parser-generator whatever.
Anyway, OJ includes some constructions that extend syntax, e.g. custom operators declaration.
