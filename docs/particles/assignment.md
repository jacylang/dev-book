# Assignment

Assignment in _Jacy_ as in Rust is per-byte copy operation and is not overloadable.

The reasons why overloading is not allowed are:

1. Assignment is too basic operation to allow users to alter its behavior.
2. Overloading of assignment brings bunch of implicitness that is not appreciated in _Jacy_
3. It complicates the logic for devs as for target users.
