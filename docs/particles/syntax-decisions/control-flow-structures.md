# Control-Flow structures

The control flow of _Jacy_ is mostly inspired by Rust.

We've got `if`/`if let` as an expression, `loop` as an expression, `while`/`while let` and `for`.

`while`/`while let` and `for` are statements, because:

* Why we need to use them as expressions if they return `()` (unit)
* I'm trying to solve the problem above, and it will be solved they'll become expression which returns an any-type value
* If I made them expressions then it would break backward compatibility:
  * You could put them in expression place, but they returned `()`, and in the new version, they started returning some
    non-`()` value

## `if`/`if let`

`if` is an expression, works the same as in other languages, here's nothing to say about except that I need to note that
_Jacy_ does not support implicit `bool` conversion even through operator overloading like C++ does.

### `if let`

`if let` is a way to check if some value matches a specific pattern. Also, as this is a pattern matching we able to
destruct our value.

Syntax is following.

```antlr4
ifLetExpression: 'if let' pattern '=' expr block
```

## `while`/`while let`

`while` is a statement that works the same as `while` in other c-like languages

`while let` is the same as `while` except that its condition behaves like `if let`.

### `while`/`while let` are expressions

Here are some thoughts about possible solutions.

```jc
while myval {
    // Do something if `myval` is true
} else {
    // Do something if `myval` is false (at first)
}
```

It is an obvious solution, but has some problems:

* As far as `while` can return some value it must explicitly `break` with value. We cannot just use the last statement
  of the `while` block as the result value, because `while` is possibly multiple-times iterable.

* If we don't `break` with value, then what would be the result? - It cannot be simply written in asm-like code with
  jumps, because we don't know when our `while` "does not break".

Problem example.

```jc
let a = while myval {
    if somethingElse => break true
} else {
    false
}
```

* What is the type of this `while` expression? - `bool | ()`, but we don't support inferred union types.

For now, I cannot come up with any good solution, so `while` is a statement. Anyway, let's try something:

**IDEA \#1** This one requires static-analysis (maybe complex).

```jc
let a = while myval {
    if somethingElse => break true
    break false
} else {
    false
}
```

We can analyze this code and say that each `break`-value is `bool`, so we allow this.

What about this?.

```jc
let a = while myval {
    if somethingElse => break true
} else {
    false
}
```

Each `break`-value is of type `bool`, so we allow it because the alternative workflow is an infinite loop.

We required some static-analysis on `while`, which is, as I see, is not really complex and not differs much from the
`if` expression value inference. The only problem is that the use cases of `while-else` are not common, especially when
we cover only this use case.

```jc
let a = if myval {
    let mut result = false
    while myval {
        // ...
        if somethingElse {
            result = true
            break
        }
    }
    return result
} else {
    false
}
```

## `for` loop

`for`-loop is a statement, not an expression, here, problems with making it an expression are the same as for `while`
(read above) but even more complex. `for`-loop in _Jacy_ has only one syntax (`for ... in ...`) same as Rust, which
covers all usages (almost) of `for`-loop from C++.

The syntax is the following.

```antlr4
forLoop: 'for' pattern 'in' expression block
```

Examples.

```c++
// In C++ we write
for (int i = 0; i < something; i++) {
    // ...
}

```jc
// In Jacy:
for i in 0..=something {
    // ...
}
```

```c++
// In C++
for (const auto & x : vec) {
    // ...
}
```

```jc
// In Jacy
for x in &vec {
    // ...
}
```
