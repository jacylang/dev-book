# Structural/Nominal typing

I wanna both:

* Structurally typed records (aka `record` or named-tuple)
* Nominally typed records (aka `struct`)
* Structurally typed tuples (raw tuples)
* Nominally typed tuples (aka rustish tuple-structs)

## Problems

### Structurally typed records

I consider using `()` for tuples and `{}` for structs. Anyway, there are some problems, as far as we've got
block-expression. `{}` can be either a block-expression, either struct literal. This is why struct-literal is always
nominal: `path::to::Struct {...}`.

Why not use `()` and use named-tuples for structurally typed records? - I want to change syntax of lambda functions
(which now use `|params...| expression` syntax) to `(params...) -> expression`. As far as lambda parameters can have
type annotation we cannot disambiguate named-tuple and lambda parameters, because in named-tuple we have `name:
expression` but in lambda parameters `name: type`.

#### Solutions

##### \#1 I don't like this one anyway

* Use `|params...| expression` syntax for lambda functions
* Use `(name: expression)` syntax for named-tuples

##### #2

* Use `record {name: expression}`

Why this is a bad solution:

* We reserve new keyword for mostly

##### #3

This is the most complex way, but it likely will allow us to save all preferred syntaxes. We improve parsing of
expressions enclosed into `()` and save everything inside `()` into some stack. Then if we see that there's a `->` after
`)` -- it is a lambda, otherwise -- it is a named-tuple. As knowing that, we can parse tokens inside `()` considering
`something` in `(name: something)` to be either an expression either type.

Example.

```jc
let a = (name: 123)
let b = (param: i32) -> param + 1
```

When we parse `a`'s and `b`'s assigned expressions we see `(`, then collect all tokens until we find `)` and if we found
`->` after `)` -- we parse these tokens as lambda parameters (`b` case), if there isn't `->` after `)` -- we parse
tokens as named-tuple (`a` case).

###### #4

* Do not have structurally typed records at all
