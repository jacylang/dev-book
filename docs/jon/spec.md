# _JON_ Specificiation

_JON_ is an alternative to JSON I've made for _Jacy_.
Though this page is called "Specification", better think of it as of grammar description.

## Why _JON_?

Spoiler: No clear reasons, I just like create "my" things.

JSON is a very popular format used mostly everywhere, so why do we need a different format?

- It is more liberal than JSON but still obvious and simple
- It is more human friendly but not that hard as YAML
- It is more complex than JSON, in a good way üòá

_JON_ was also made as an alternative to TOML, as _Jacy_ is similar to **Rust** that uses TOML.
I really don't like TOML üòê.

## Grammar

Here, I'll use ANTLR4-like grammar as it is more readable than EBNF.

```antlr4

```
