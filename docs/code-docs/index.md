# Code Docs

Before compilation workflow, it is important to overview compiler source code structure, some documentation is written
directly in the code in documentation comments style, but there's a lack of them and also these docs mostly give some
important notes but not how to use specific class, method, etc.

If you want to contribute to _Jacy_ this is a good place to start sorting out compiler structure. Anyway, I need to note
that _Jacy_ is very WIP so some things change often and this documentation would become non-relevant one day.
